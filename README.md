## Description

- Users/Management needs to be able to create and view information about teams and employees. I wanted to create a CMS interface that allowed for non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.

- I created a command-line application completely from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
